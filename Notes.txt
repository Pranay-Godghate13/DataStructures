NOTES
-Adjacency Matrix:
    Cons: - Occupy > space, contain unused data too in form of Zero's.
          - Time complexity=O(v), which is greater than Adjacency list, considering in mind v is very large.
-Edge list is used to sort an array list, used in Minimum spanning tree (MST) Algorithim.
-Implicit graph: Flood fill algorithim.
-BFS time complexity is O(V+E).
-DFS time complexity is O(V+E).
-Prims Algo time complexity is O(Elog(E)).
-Topological sort is only applicable on DAC.
-DAC stands for Directed Acyclic graph.
-Dijkstra Algorithim is a greedy algorithim.
-Bellmond ford algorithim is a DP algorithim.
-MST: Minimum spanning tree.
    - Undirected & weighted graph.
    - Subgraph of graph.
    - Cycle absent.
    - min possible edge weight.
-Condition of MST:
    -Prim's Algorithim
        -Node connected.
        -No Cycle.
        -Cost minimum.
