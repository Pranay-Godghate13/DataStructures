NOTES
-Adjacency Matrix:
    Cons: - Occupy > space, contain unused data too in form of Zero's.
          - Time complexity=O(v), which is greater than Adjacency list, considering in mind v is very large.
-Edge list is used to sort an array list, used in Minimum spanning tree (MST) Algorithim.
-Implicit graph: Flood fill algorithim.
